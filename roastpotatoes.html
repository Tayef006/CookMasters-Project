                        <li>
                            Put a roasting tin in the oven (one big enough to take the potatoes in a 
                            single layer) and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Peel 1kg potatoes and cut each into 4 even-sized pieces if they are medium size, 
                            2-3 if smaller (5cm pieces).
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Drop the potatoes into a large pan and pour in enough water to barely cover them.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Add salt, then wait for the water to boil. As soon as the water reaches a full 
                            rolling boil, lower the heat, put your timer on and simmer the potatoes uncovered, reasonably vigorously, for 2 mins.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Meanwhile, put 100g duck or goose fat or 100ml olive oil into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a 
                            few minutes, so it’s really hot.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Drain the potatoes in a colander, then shake the colander back and forth a few times to fluff up the outsides.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Sprinkle with 2 tsp flour and give another shake or two so they are evenly and thinly coated.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Carefully put the potatoes into the hot fat – they will sizzle as they go in – then turn and roll them around so 
                            they are coated all over.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Spread them in a single layer making sure they have plenty of room.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Roast the potatoes for 15 mins, then take them out of the oven and turn them over.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Roast for another 15 mins and turn them over again. Put them back in the oven for another 10-20 mins, or however 
                            long it takes to get them really golden and crisp. The colouring will be uneven, which is what you want.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Scatter with the sea salt flakes and serve straightaway.
                        </li>

                        <p><strong>Comment:</strong> They were crispy, fluffy, and beautifully golden. The timings were spot-on, but I’d suggest checking them a bit earlier if your oven runs hot.</p>
